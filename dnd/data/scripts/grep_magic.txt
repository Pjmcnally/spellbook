This is the grep/loop I wrote to clean out all the unnecessary lines I didn't want.

line 8 creates a loop over each file in the folder
line 9, 10, 12 redirct all lines that do NO match the regex to a new temp file
lines 11, 13 remove unneeded temp files.
line 15 renames the last temp file to overwrite the original file.

for file in ./*.md ; do
    grep -vE "^---$" $file > $file.1.tmp;
    grep -vE "^layout: post$" $file.1.tmp > $file.2.tmp;
    rm $file.1.tmp;
    grep -vE "^date:.+$" $file.2.tmp > $file.3.tmp;
    rm $file.2.tmp;
    mv $file.3.tmp $file;
done
